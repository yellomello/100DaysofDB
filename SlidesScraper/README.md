CMU Slides Auto Downloader

This project is a simple Python utility that automatically downloads lecture slides (PDFs) from the CMU 15-445 Database Systems course
 (or any webpage with linked PDFs). It checks for new files and saves them locally, so you don‚Äôt have to click each link manually.

üìÇ Project Files

app.py
The main Python script.

Connects to the specified webpage.

Extracts all PDF links.

Downloads them into a local folder.

Skips already-downloaded files to avoid duplicates.

app.bat
A Windows batch file.

Launches app.py using pythonw.exe (runs silently in the background).

Can be placed in the Windows Startup folder to run automatically at login.

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Python 3.7+ installed on your machine.

Python modules:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

üöÄ How to Use
1. Run Once Manually
python app.py


This will download all PDFs into your specified folder:

C:\Users\hanse\Desktop\cleanup\Sep 2025\CMUDB\Lecture 1\File Download Script

2. Run Silently on Windows

Edit app.bat to point to your script:

pythonw.exe "C:\path\to\app.py"


Test it by double-clicking app.bat.

If everything works, PDFs should download without opening a console window.

3. Auto-Run at Startup

Press Win + R, type:

shell:startup


and hit Enter.

Copy app.bat into the Startup folder.
‚úÖ Now the downloader will run automatically each time you log in.

üîÑ Optional: Scheduled Checks

If you want to periodically check for new files:

Windows: Use Task Scheduler to run app.bat every 30 minutes.

Linux/macOS: Use cron with an entry like:

*/30 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/app.py

üìñ Description

This tool automates the process of collecting lecture slides from the CMU Database Systems course website. It‚Äôs designed for students (or anyone following the course) who want an up-to-date offline copy of the slides without manually downloading them.

It can easily be adapted for any course or website by changing the url variable in app.py.
